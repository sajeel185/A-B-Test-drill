    "\n",
    "Two versions for this A/B test: Version A will be the new supplement, and Version B will be older supplement currently in use (our control group).  For the purpose of this discussion, lets assume that there is a older supplement currently in use.\n",

    "Hypothesis: The new supplement will help people sleep better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample: From those people that are currently taking the older supplement, choose a random subset of 2000 people based on similar age, health, and similar individual stress levels, and divide them into two equal groups.  Include males and females in both groups.  We will administer Version A to the first group and Version B to the second group.\n",

    "Outcome of interest: the total amount of continous sleep each person in the two different versions of our sample groups experienced, measured in hours.\n",

    "Process: We will have each subject come into our clinic every night for a period of three months, to sleep in a controlled environment, where we will monitor his/her sleeping duration.  If the sleeping duration increased by atleast 10% more in the group with Version A, versus Version B, we will conclude that the new supplement does help people sleep better.\n",

Than compare the sales from Version A with the sales of Version B, and also compare them to the total sales for the same time periods from last year.  If we see atleast a 15% increase in sales from Version A, when compared to last year's sales, than we can conclude that the new uniforms will help the gym's business.\n",
